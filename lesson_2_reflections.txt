What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

Git begins categorizing the files in the directory and creates an empty repository.  This is necessary so you can add files to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate step.  It allows you to group files together before adding them to the repository.

Version Control Lesson 1 Reflections 

1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug? 

It was helpful because it eliminated text that was not changed between the two versions. 

(2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? 

If you make a mistake, you will be able to return to an earlier version of the document.

(3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? 

Manually choosing to commit allows you to make the commits more logical.  On the other hand, if you are forgetful, you may neglect to commit often enough. 

(4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiples files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately? 

Files for certain systems are typically interrelated, whereas for others they are typically not related. 

(5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

By typing in the appropriate instructions in terminal and scrolling through.

(6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? 

You will be able easily to return to the previous logical step. 

(7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? 

Programming.
